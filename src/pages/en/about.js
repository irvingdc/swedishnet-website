          Swedish Net offers services and contracts for vital societal
          facilities and functions which have high requirements on security and
          technology due to potential threats. For 20 years, we have delivered
          solutions for government agencies, protected objects and critical
          infrastructure. All of our clients require advanced facility security
          due to, for example, terrorism and other antagonistic threats. Our

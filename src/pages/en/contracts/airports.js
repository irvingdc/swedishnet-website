        Scandinavian Mountains Airport is the first airport for regular traffic
        being built in Sweden in over 19 years. The airport is being built in
        SÃ¤len, close to the Norwegian border. It will fulfill CAT III, the
        highest category for runways (the same as Arlanda). It is estimated that
        in December 2019, the first national and international flights will land
        on Scandinavian Mountains Airport, one of the most modern airports in
        Europe.

        installation of AGL, electrical power supply system and infrastructure
        for power and communication at the new airport. 120 km cable and 1250
